Discord allows developers to register [slash commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands), which provide users a first-class way of interacting directly with your application. 

Here is a quick [1 minute explanation video from Discord](https://youtu.be/4XxcpBxSCiU). If you want a more technical explanation, you can read the [blog post by Discord](https://blog.discord.com/slash-commands-are-here-8db0a385d9e6). You can also always refer to [Discord's official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands).

To make slash commands work, you need to do two things:

1. **Register the structure of the slash command**: You need to register your slash commands so Discord can display them in the command picker. This is how slash commands look like in the command picker.

![Command Picker](./images/commandpicker.png)

2. **Reply to the slash command**: When a user use your slash command, your bot needs to reply to it. This is essentially the `index.js` file that you've created so far.

::: warning
You only need to register the structure of your slash commands once. You will see what we mean by "structure" in the next section.

Once your commands have been registered, they will "stay" in Discord. Anything you do in your local files after this point will **not** affect the structure of the commands that have been registered already. You can edit the structure of a slash command or delete an existing slash command by registering a "new set of commands".
:::

This page will only cover the bare minimum to get you started, but you can refer to our [in-depth page on slash commands](/interactions/registering-slash-commands.md) for a more detailed guide.

## Authorization

Before you start registering slash commands, make sure your bot has the `applications.commands` scope for the particular server that you will be working with. Refer back to [Adding your bot to servers](../preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.md) if you haven't done so already.

## Registering slash commands

As we mentioned earlier, you only have to register the structure of your slash commands once. As such, we strongly recommend creating a separate `deploy-commands.js` file in your project directory. This file will be used to register, edit, and/or delete slash commands for your bot application.

```:no-line-numbers {4}
discord-bot/
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy-commands.js // <-- Create a new file named deploy-commands.js
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Next, you'll need to install [`@discordjs/builders`](https://github.com/discordjs/builders), [`@discordjs/rest`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js-modules/blob/main/packages/rest/), and [`discord-api-types`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types/).

```sh:no-line-numbers
npm install @discordjs/builders @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

Let's suppose you want to register these three slash commands for your bot: `/ping`, `/server`, and `/user`.

![Command Picker](./images/commandpicker.png)

Here's what your `deploy-commands.js` will look like:
:::: code-group
::: code-group-item deploy-commands.js
```js{4,6-11,17-21}
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require('@discordjs/builders');
const { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');
const { Routes } = require('discord-api-types/v9');
const { clientId, guildId, token } = require('./config.json');

// Define an array with three slash commands structure
const commands = [
	new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('ping').setDescription('Replies with pong!'),
	new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('server').setDescription('Replies with server info!'),
	new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('user').setDescription('Replies with user info!'),
].map(command => command.toJSON());

const rest = new REST({ version: '9' }).setToken(token);

(async () => {
	try {
		// Register the array of slash commands with res.put()
		await rest.put(
			Routes.applicationGuildCommands(clientId, guildId),
			{ body: commands },
		);

		console.log('Successfully registered application commands.');
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
	}
})();
```
:::
::: code-group-item config.json
```json {2-3}
{
	"clientId": "123456789012345678",
	"guildId": "876543210987654321",
	"token": "your-token-goes-here"
}
```
:::
::::

Focus on these variables:

- `clientId`: Your client's id
- `guildId`: Your development server's id
- `commands`: An array of commands to register. 

The [`SlashCommandBuilder()`](/popular-topics/builders.md#Slash-command-builders) from the [`@discordjs/builders`](https://github.com/discordjs/builders) module is used to build the structure for your commands. As you can see from the deployment script above, the structure of the `/ping` command has a name `ping` and a description `Replies with pong!`. The structure can include other things such as subcommand, options, choices, permission, etc. You can refer to our [in-depth page on slash commands](/interactions/registering-slash-commands.md) to learn more about it.

::: tip
In order to get your client and guild IDs, open Discord and go to your settings. On the "Advanced" page, turn on "Developer Mode". This will enable a "Copy ID" button in the context menu when you right-click on a server icon, a user's profile, etc.
:::

Once you fill in those variables, run:
```sh:no-line-numbers
node deploy-commands.js
``` 
in your project directory to register the structure of your slash commands to your specified guild.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully registered your slash commands. Go ahead and type `/` in your guild and you should be able to see your slash commands already:

![Command Picker](./images/commandpicker.png)

## Replying to slash commands

Once you've registered your slash commands, you can reply to them with your bot. Let's go back to your `index.js` file, and add these lines:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item index.js
```js {10-12}
const { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS] });

client.once('ready', () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {
	console.log(interaction);
});

client.login(token);
```
:::
::::

A slash command is just one type of [interaction](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#Slash-commands). Therefore, you can make your bot listen to the [`interactionCreate`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client?scrollTo=e-interactionCreate) event to receive incoming interactions. Let's log the incoming interaction with `console.log(interaction)` to make sure your bot is working properly. Go ahead and start the bot with:

```sh:no-line-numbers
node index.js
```

and then use the `/ping` command in your guild. You should see something logged in your terminal that is similar to this:

```:no-line-numbers
CommandInteraction {
  type: 'APPLICATION_COMMAND',
  id: '123',
  applicationId: '123',
  channelId: '123',
  guildId: '123',
  user: User { ... },
  member: GuildMember { ... },
  version: 1,
  commandId: '123',
  commandName: 'ping',
  deferred: false,
  options: CommandInteractionOptionResolver {
    _group: null,
    _subcommand: null,
    _hoistedOptions: []
  },
  replied: false,
  ephemeral: null,
  webhook: InteractionWebhook { id: '123' }
}
```

If you see something like that in your terminal, then your bot is receiving the interaction events correctly! However, your bot hasn't replied to the interaction yet, which is why you will see something like this in your Discord:

![](./images/interactionfailed.png)

Let's go ahead and fix that by replying to the interaction:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item index.js
```js {11-21}
const { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS] });

client.once('ready', () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isCommand()) return;

	const { commandName } = interaction;

	if (commandName === 'ping') {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
	} else if (commandName === 'server') {
		await interaction.reply(`Server name: ${interaction.guild.name}\nTotal members: ${interaction.guild.memberCount}`);
	} else if (commandName === 'user') {
		await interaction.reply(`Your tag: ${interaction.user.tag}\nYour id: ${interaction.user.id}`);
	}
});

client.login(token);
```
:::
::::

As we mentioned earlier, a slash command is just one type of interaction. Therefore, you should first check if the interaction is a slash command by calling `interaction.isCommand()` (line 11). 

Next, you should check the name of the command by accessing the `commandName` property (line 13). Once you have the name of the command, you can use some `if`/`else if` statements to reply accordingly. 

Finally, you reply to the interaction by calling `interaction.reply()`.

::: warning
You must reply to the interaction within **three seconds** of receiving it.
:::

For the `ping` command (line 16), you simply reply back with a `Pong!` message.

For the `server` command (line 18), you can access the `.guild` property, which refers to the guild the interaction was sent in. Note that Discord servers are referred to as "guilds" in the Discord API and discord.js library. This `.guild` is an instance of [Guild](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Guild) which exposes properties such as `.name` and `.memberCount`.

::: tip
Refer to the <DocsLink path="class/Guild" /> documentation for a list of all the available properties and methods!
:::

For the `user` command (line 20), you can access the `.user` property, which refers to the user who used the command. This `.user` is an instance of [User](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/User) which exposes properties such as `.tag` and `.id`.

::: tip
Refer to the <DocsLink path="class/User" /> documentation for a list of all the available properties and methods!
:::

Now that your bot is replying to your slash commands, let's start the bot again:
```sh:no-line-numbers
node index.js
```
and then use the `/ping` command in your guild. This time, you should see something like this instead:

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<template #interactions>
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" :command="true">ping</DiscordInteraction>
		</template>
		Pong!
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You now have three working slash commands. Go ahead and try out `/server` and `/user` as well. 

Your `/server` should look like this:

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<template #interactions>
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" :command="true">server</DiscordInteraction>
		</template>
		Server name: Discord.js Guide
		<br />
		Total members: 2
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

And your `/user` should look like this:

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<template #interactions>
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" :command="true">user</DiscordInteraction>
		</template>
		Your tag: User#0001
		<br />
		Your id: 123456789012345678
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

And there you have it!

## The problem with `if`/`else if`

If you don't plan on making more than a couple commands, then using an `if`/`else if` chain is fine; however, this isn't always the case. Using a giant `if`/`else if` chain will only hinder your development process in the long run.

Here's a small list of reasons why you shouldn't do so:

* Takes longer to find a piece of code you want;
* Easier to fall victim to [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code);
* Difficult to maintain as it grows;
* Difficult to debug;
* Difficult to organize;
* General bad practice.

Next, we'll be diving into something called a "command handler"â€“code that makes handling commands easier and much more efficient. This allows you to move your commands into individual files.
