# Creating commands

::: tip
This page is a follow-up and bases its code on [the previous page](/creating-your-bot/).

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<template #interactions>
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" :command="true">ping</DiscordInteraction>
		</template>
		Pong!
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

Discord allows developers to register [Slash Commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands), which provide users a first-class way of interacting directly with your application. 

To make Slash Commands work, we need to do two things:

1. **Register the _structure_ of the Slash Command**: In this step, we are essentially telling Discord:
> "Show *these* commands to the user when they type `/` in the chat."
2. **Reply to the Slash Command**: In this step, we decide *what* and *how* to reply to the user who used our Slash Command. This is essentially our "bot" (the `index.js` that we've created so far).

::: warning
You only need to register the *structure* of your Slash Commands **ONCE**. You can edit the *structure* of a Slash Command by registering it again with a new *structure*. We will see what we mean by "*structure*" in the next section.
:::

This page will only cover the bare minimum to get you started, but you can refer to our [in-depth page on Slash Commands](/interactions/slash-commands.md) for a more detailed guide.

## Registering Slash Commands

As we mentioned earlier, we only have to register the structure of our Slash Commands **once**. As such, **we strongly recommend creating a separate `deploy-commands.js` file** in your project directory. This file will be used to register, edit, and delete Slash Commands for your bot application.

```:no-line-numbers {4}
discord-bot/
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy-commands.js // <-- Create a new file named deploy-commands.js
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Next, you'll need to install [`@discordjs/builders`](https://github.com/discordjs/builders), [`@discordjs/rest`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js-modules/blob/main/packages/rest/), and [`discord-api-types`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types/).

```sh:no-line-numbers
npm install @discordjs/builders @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

Let's suppose we want to register these 3 Slash Commands for our bot: `/ping`, `/server`, and `/user`.

![](./images/commandpicker.png)

Here's what your `deploy-commands.js` will look like:
:::: code-group
::: code-group-item deploy-commands.js
```js{4,6-11,17-21}
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require('@discordjs/builders');
const { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');
const { Routes } = require('discord-api-types/v9');
const { clientId, guildId, token } = require('./config.json');

// Define an array with 3 Slash Commands structure
const commands = [
	new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('ping').setDescription('Replies with pong!'),
	new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('server').setDescription('Replies with server info!'),
	new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('user').setDescription('Replies with user info!'),
].map(command => command.toJSON());

const rest = new REST({ version: '9' }).setToken(token);

(async () => {
	try {
		// Register the array of Slash Commands with res.put()
		await rest.put(
			Routes.applicationGuildCommands(clientId, guildId),
			{ body: commands },
		);

		console.log('Successfully registered application commands.');
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
	}
})();
```
:::
::: code-group-item config.json
```json {2-3}
{
	"clientId": "123456789012345678",
	"guildId": "876543210987654321",
	"token": "your-token-goes-here"
}
```
:::
::::

Focus on these variables:

- `clientId`: Your client's id
- `guildId`: Your development server's id
- `commands`: An array of commands to register. 

The [`SlashCommandBuilder()`](/popular-topics/builders.md#Slash-command-builders) is used to build the structure for your commands. As you can see from the script above, the structure of the `/ping` command has a name `ping` and a description `Replies with pong!`. The structure can include other things such as subcommand, options, choices, permission, etc. You can refer to our [in-depth page on Slash Commands](/interactions/slash-commands.md) to learn more about it.

::: tip
In order to get your client and guild ids, open Discord and go to your settings. On the "Advanced" page, turn on "Developer Mode". This will enable a "Copy ID" button in the context menu when you right-click on a server icon, a user's profile, etc.
:::

Once you fill in those variables, run:
```sh:no-line-numbers
node deploy-commands.js
``` 
in your project directory to register the structure of your Slash Commands to your specified guild.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully registered your Slash Commands. Go ahead and type `/` in your guild and you should be able to see your Slash Commands already:

![](./images/commandpicker.png)

::: warning
Once your commands have been registered, they will "stay" in Discord. Anything you do in your `deploy-commands.js` file after this point will **NOT** affect the commands that have been registered already. 

If you do any of the following:
- Add a new command to the `commands` array
- Edit an existing command's structure (e.g. changing `setDescription('Replies with pong!')` to `setDescription('some random description')`)
- Remove a command from the `commands` array

you will need to run `node deploy-commands.js` again to register the "new" set of commands to Discord.
:::

## Replying to Slash Commands

Once you've registered your Slash Commands, users can now use your Slash Commands! Our next step is to make our bot reply to those Slash Commands. Let's go back to our `index.js` file, and add these lines:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item index.js
```js {13-15}
// Require the necessary discord.js classes
const { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

// Create a new client instance
const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS] });

// When the client is ready, run this code (only once)
client.once('ready', () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {
	console.log(interaction)
});

// Login to Discord with your client's token
client.login(token);
```
:::
::::

A Slash Command is just one type of [interaction](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#Slash-commands). Therefore, we can make our bot listen to the [`interactionCreate`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client?scrollTo=e-interactionCreate) event to receive incoming interactions. So far, we only have a `console.log(interaction)` in the callback. Go ahead and start the bot with:
```sh:no-line-numbers
node index.js
```
and then use the `/ping` command in your guild. You should see something logged in your terminal that is similar to this:
```:no-line-numbers
CommandInteraction {
  type: 'APPLICATION_COMMAND',
  id: '123',
  applicationId: '123',
  channelId: '123',
  guildId: '123',
  user: User { ... },
  member: GuildMember { ... },
  version: 1,
  commandId: '123',
  commandName: 'ping',
  deferred: false,
  options: CommandInteractionOptionResolver {
    _group: null,
    _subcommand: null,
    _hoistedOptions: []
  },
  replied: false,
  ephemeral: null,
  webhook: InteractionWebhook { id: '123' }
}
```

If you see something like that getting logged in your terminal, then that means your bot is receiving the interaction event correctly! However, our bot hasn't replied to the interaction yet, which is why you will see something like this in your Discord:

![](./images/interactionfailed.png)

Let's go ahead and fix that by making these changes inside the callback:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item index.js
```js {14-22}
// Require the necessary discord.js classes
const { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

// Create a new client instance
const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS] });

// When the client is ready, run this code (only once)
client.once('ready', () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isCommand()) return;

	if (interaction.commandName === 'ping') {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
	} else if (interaction.commandName === 'server') {
		await interaction.reply(`Server name: ${interaction.guild.name}\nTotal members: ${interaction.guild.memberCount}`);
	} else if (interaction.commandName === 'user') {
		await interaction.reply(`Your tag: ${interaction.user.tag}\nYour id: ${interaction.user.id}`);
	}
});

// Login to Discord with your client's token
client.login(token);
```
:::
::::

As we mentioned earlier, a Slash Command is just one type of interaction. Therefore, we should first check if the interaction is a Slash Command by calling `.isCommand()`. Next, we check the name of the command by accessing the `.commandName` property. Finally, we reply to the interaction by calling `.reply()`.

::: danger
You MUST reply to the interaction within **3 seconds** of receiving it.
:::

Now that we have it fixed, let's start the bot again:
```sh:no-line-numbers
node index.js
```
and then use the `/ping` command in your guild. This time, you should see something like this instead:

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<template #interactions>
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" :command="true">ping</DiscordInteraction>
		</template>
		Pong!
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You now have 3 working Slash Commands. Go ahead and try out `/server` and `/user` as well. 

Your `/server` should look like this:

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<template #interactions>
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" :command="true">server</DiscordInteraction>
		</template>
		Server name: Discord.js Guide
		<br />
		Total members: 2
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

And your `/user` should look like this:

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage profile="bot">
		<template #interactions>
			<DiscordInteraction profile="user" :command="true">user</DiscordInteraction>
		</template>
		Your tag: User#0001
		<br />
		Your id: 123456789012345678
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

And there you have it!

## The problem with `if`/`else if`

If you don't plan on making more than a couple commands, then using an `if`/`else if` chain is fine; however, this isn't always the case. Using a giant `if`/`else if` chain will only hinder your development process in the long run.

Here's a small list of reasons why you shouldn't do so:

* Takes longer to find a piece of code you want;
* Easier to fall victim to [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code);
* Difficult to maintain as it grows;
* Difficult to debug;
* Difficult to organize;
* General bad practice.

Next, we'll be diving into something called a "command handler"â€“code that makes handling commands easier and much more efficient. This allows you to move your commands into individual files.
