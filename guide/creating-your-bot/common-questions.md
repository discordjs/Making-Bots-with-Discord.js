```

### How do I add a role to a guild member?

const role = <guild>.roles.find('name', '<role name>');
const member = <message>.mentions.members.first();
member.addRole(role);
```

### How do I check if a guild member has a certain role?

	// ...
}

## Bot Configuration

### How do I set my username?

```js
<client>.user.setUsername('<username>');
```

### How do I set my avatar?

```js
<client>.user.setAvatar('<url or path>');
```

### How do I set my playing status?

```js
<client>.user.setGame('<game>');
```

**Notes:**

* If you would like to set your playing status upon startup, you must place the `<client>.user.setGame()` method in a `ready` event listener (`client.on('ready', () => {});`).

* If you're using a selfbot to change your playing status, you won't be able to view the status change, but other users will.

			<message>.channel.send(`You've entered: ${messages.first().content}`);
		})
		.catch(() => {
			<message>.channel.send('You did not enter any input!');
		});
});
```

### What is the difference between a User and a GuildMember?

A lot of users get confused as to what the difference between Users and GuildMembers is. The simple answer is that a User represent a global Discord user and a GuildMember represents a Discord user on a specific server. That means only GuildMembers can have permissions, roles, and nicknames, for example, because all these things are server-bound information that could be different on every server that user is in.
