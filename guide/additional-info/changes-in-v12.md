# A Brief Primer Updating from v11 to v12

After a long time in development, Discord.js v12 is nearing a stable release, meaning it's time to update from v11 to get new features for your bots!  However, with those new features comes a lot of changes to the library that will break code written for v11.  This guide will serve as a handy reference for updating your code, covering the most commonly-used methods that have been changed, new topics such as partials and internal sharding, and will also include a comprehensive list of the method and property changes at the end.

## Before You Start

v12 requires Node 10.x or higher to  use, so make sure you're up-to-date.  To check your Node version, use `node -v` in your terminal or command prompt, and if it's not high enough, update it!  There are many resources online to help you get up-to-date.

For now, you do need Git installed and added to your PATH environment, so ensure that's done as well - again, guides are available online for a wide variety of operating systems.  Once you have Node up-to-date and Git installed, you can install v12 by running `npm install discordjs/discord.js` in your terminal or command prompt for text-only use, or `npm install discordjs/discord.js node-opus` for voice support.

## Commonly Used Methods That Changed

* All section headers are named in the following convention: `Class#methodOrProperty`.
* The use of parenthesis designates optional inclusion. For example, `Channel#fetch(Pinned)Message(s)` means that this section will include changes for `Channel#fetchPinnedMessages`, `Channel#fetchMessages`, and `Channel#fetchMessage`.
* The use of asterisks designates a wildcard. For example, `Channel#send***` means that this section will include changes for `Channel#sendMessage`, `Channel#sendFile`, `Channel#sendEmbed`, and so forth.

### Fetch

Some methods that retrieve uncached data have been changed, transformed in the shape of a DataStore.

```diff
- client.fetchUser('123456789012345678');
+ client.users.fetch('123456789012345678');

- guild.fetchMember('123456789012345678');
+ guild.members.fetch('123456789012345678');

- guild.fetchMembers();
+ guild.members.fetch();

- textChannel.fetchMessage('123456789012345678');
+ textChannel.messages.fetch('123456789012345678');

- textChannel.fetchMessages({ limit: 10 });
+ textChannel.messages.fetch({ limit: 10 });

- textChannel.fetchPinnedMessages();
+ textChannel.messages.fetchPinned();
```

### Send

All the `.send***()` methods have been removed in favor of one general `.send()` method.

```diff
- channel.sendMessage('Hey!');
+ channel.send('Hey!');

- channel.sendEmbed(embedVariable);
+ channel.send(embedVariable);
+ channel.send({ embed: embedVariable });
```

<p class="warning">`channel.send(embedVariable)` will only work if that variable is an instance of the `MessageEmbed` class; object literals won't give you the expected result unless your embed data is inside an `embed` key.</p>

```diff
- channel.sendCode('js', 'const version = 11;');
+ channel.send('const version = 12;', { code: 'js' });

- channel.sendFile('./file.png');
- channel.sendFiles(['./file-one.png', './file-two.png']);
+ channel.send({
  files: [{
    attachment: 'entire/path/to/file.jpg',
    name: 'file.jpg'
  }]
+ channel.send({
  files: ['https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/222078108977594368/6e1019b3179d71046e463a75915e7244.png?size=2048']
});
```

### Roles

The `GuildMember.roles` Collection has been changed to a DataStore in v12, so a lot of the associated methods for interacting with a member's roles have changed as well.  They're no longer on the GuildMember object itself, but instead now on the `GuildMemberRoleStore` Data Store.

```diff
- guildMember.addRole('123456789012345678');
- guildMember.addRoles(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);
+ guildMember.roles.add('123456789012345678');
+ guildMember.roles.add(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);

- guildMember.removeRole('123456789012345678');
- guildMember.removeRoles(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);
+ guildMember.roles.remove('123456789012345678');
+ guildMember.roles.remove(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);

- guildMember.setRoles(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);
+ guildMember.roles.set(['123456789012345678', '098765432109876543']);
```

In addition, the GuildMember properties related to roles have also been moved to the `GuildMemberRoleStore` Data Store.

```diff
- guildMember.colorRole;
+ guildMember.roles.color;

- guildMember.highestRole;
+ guildMember.roles.highest;

- guildMember.hoistRole;
+ guildMember.roles.hoist;
```

### Ban and Unban

The method to ban members and users have been moved to the `GuildMemberStore` Data Store.

```diff
- guildMember.ban();
- guild.ban('123456789012345678');
+ guild.members.ban('123456789012345678');

- guild.unban('123456789012345678');
+ guild.members.unban('123456789012345678');
+
```

### Image URLs

Some image-related properties like `user.avatarURL` are now a method in v12, so that you can apply some options to them, eg. to affect their display size.

```diff
- user.avatarURL;
+ user.avatarURL();

- user.displayAvatarURL;
+ user.displayAvatarURL();

- guild.iconURL;
+ guild.iconURL();

- guild.splashURL;
+ guild.splashURL();
```

### RichEmbed Constructor

The RichEmbed constructor has been removed and is now called `MessageEmbed`.  It is largely the same to use, the only difference being the removal of `RichEmbed.attachFile()` - `MessageEmbed.attachFiles()` accepts a single file as a parameter as well.

### String Concatenation

v12 has changed how string concatenation works with stringifying objects.  The `valueOf` any data structure will return its id, which affects how it behaves in strings, eg. using an object for a mention.  In v11, you used to be able to use `channel.send(userObject + ' has joined!')` and it would automatically stringify the object and it would become the mention (`@user has joined!`), but in v12, it will now send a message that says `123456789012345678 has joined` instead.  Using template literals (\`\`) will still return the mention, however.

```diff
- channel.send(userObject + ' has joined!')
+ channel.send(`${userObject} has joined!`)
```

### User Account-Only Methods

All user account-only methods have been removed, as they are no longer publicly accessible from the API.

<p class="danger">This stuff should keep getting shoved to the bottom, with the commonly-used methods that are changed, as well as topic overviews added before it.</p>

The section headers for breaking changes will be named after the v11 classes/methods/properties and will be in alphabetical order, so that you can easily find what you're looking for. The section headers for additions will be named after the v12 classes/methods/properties, to reflect their current syntax appropriately.

"Difference" codeblocks will be used to display the old methods vs the newer onesâ€”the red being what's been removed and the green being its replacement. Some bits may have more than one version of being handled. Regular JavaScript syntax codeblocks will be used to display the additions.

+ guild.emojis.resolve('123456789012345678').delete();
```

#### Guild#defaultChannel

Unfortunately, "default" channels don't exist in Discord anymore, and as such, the `guild.defaultChannel` property has been removed with no alternative.

**Q:** "I previously had a welcome message system (or something similar) set up using that property. What can I do now?"

**A:** There are a few ways to tackle this. Using the example of a welcome message system, you can:

1. Set up a database table to store the channel ID in a column when someone uses a `!welcome-channel #channel-name` command, for example. Then inside the `guildMemberAdd` event, use `client.channels.get('id')` and send a message to that channel. This is the most reliable method and gives server staff freedom to rename the channel as they please.
2. Make a new command that creates a `welcome-messages` channel, use `guild.channels.find('name', 'welcome-messages')`, and send a message to that channel. This method will work fine in most cases, but will break if someone on that server decides to rename the channel. This may also give you unexpected results, due to Discord allowing multiple channels to have the same name.

<p class="tip">Not sure how to set up a database? Check out [this page](/sequelize/)!</p>

#### Guild#fetchBans

`guild.fetchBans()` will return a `Collection` of objects in v12, whereas v11 would return a `Collection` of `User` objects.

```diff
- guild.fetchBans().then(bans => console.log(`${bans.first().tag} was banned`));
+ guild.fetchBans().then(bans => console.log(`${bans.first().user.tag} was banned because "${bans.first().reason}"`));
```

#### Guild#fetchMember(s)

`guild.fetchMember()` and `guild.fetchMembers()` were both removed and transformed in the shape of DataStores. In addition, `guild.members.fetch()` will return a `Collection` of `GuildMember` objects in v12, whereas v11 would return a `Guild` object.

1. Set up a database table to store the channel ID in a column when someone uses a `!welcome-channel #channel-name` command, for example. Then inside the `guildMemberAdd` event, use `client.channels.get('id')` and send a message to that channel. This is the most reliable method and gives server staff freedom to rename the channel as they please.
2. Make a new command that creates a `welcome-messages` channel, use `guild.channels.find('name', 'welcome-messages')`, and send a message to that channel. This method will work fine in most cases, but will break if someone on that server decides to rename the channel. This may also give you unexpected results, due to Discord allowing multiple channels to have the same name.

```

#### Guild#fetchMember(s)

`guild.fetchMember()` and `guild.fetchMembers()` were both removed and transformed in the shape of DataStores. In addition, `guild.members.fetch()` will return a `Collection` of `GuildMember` objects in v12, whereas v11 would return a `Guild` object.
