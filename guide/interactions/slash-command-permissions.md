## Permissions

Need to keep some of your commands safe from prying eyes, or only available to the right people? Slash Commands support permission overwrites! For both guild and global commands, you can enable or disable a specific **user** or **role** in a guild from using a command.

::: tip
For now, if you don't have permission to use a command, they'll show up in the command picker as disabled and unusable. They will **not** be hidden.
:::

As you might have noticed now, we were able to use all of our Slash Commands right after registering them. This is because the `default_permission` of a Slash Command is set to `true` by default if you don't specify it **during registration**.

You can set the `default_permission` of your Slash Command to `false` if you want them to be disabled for everyone (literally). Setting `default_permission` to `false` will disallow *anyone* in a guild from using the commandâ€”even Administrators and guild ownersâ€”unless a specific overwrite is configured. **It will also disable the command (if it's a global one) from being usable in DMs**.

We can set the `default_permission` of a Slash Command with the `setDefaultPermission()` method of the `SlashCommandBuilder()` builder that we have been using so far. For example, if we want to do that for the `ping` command:

```js:no-line-numbers
new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('ping')
  .setDescription('Replies with pong!')
  .setDefaultPermission(false) // defaults to "true" if not specified
```

Then, we simply register the command again:
```sh:no-line-numbers
node deploy-commands.js
```

As we mentioned earlier, a Slash Command can either have `default_permission` set to `true`, which will *enable the command for everyone*, OR it can have it set to `false`, which will *disable it for everyone*. As a result, there are two different approaches for controlling the permission of a Slash Command:

- Blacklist
- Whitelist

The **blacklist** approach ENABLES the commnd for everyone (i.e. `setDefaultPermission(true)`), and then manually DISABLE the command for a specific **user** or a specific **role** in a specific guild.

The **whitelist** approach does the opposite. It DISABLES the command for everyone (i.e. `setDefaultPermission(false)`), and then manually ENABLE the command for a specific **user** or a specific **role** in a specific guild.

The process of "manually enabling/disabling the command for a specific user/role" is called **permission overwrite**.

::: warning
You can only add up to **10 permission overwrites** for a command.

**Permission overwrites are guild-specific**. In other words, you need to specify the guild that you want to do the permission overwrite in, **even if the command is a Global command**. That means that, for a given Global command, it's possible to enable it for a user in one guild, but disable it for the same user in another guild.
:::

Let's try the whitelist approach for the `ping` command. First we set the `default_permission` to `false` by using the `setDefaultPermission()` method:
```js:no-line-numbers {4}
new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('ping')
  .setDescription('Replies with pong!')
  .setDefaultPermission(false)
```

Next, we run the deployment script again to register our newly edited `ping` command:
```sh:no-line-numbers
node deploy-commands.js
```

Go ahead and try using the `/ping` command in your guild. You should see it grayed out and disabled like this:

Next, let's whitelist a specific role. We need 3 IDs for a permission overwrite:

- Guild ID
- Command ID
- User/role ID

So far, we already have the Guild ID, so:

- Command ID âœ…
- Guild ID
- User/role ID

With these 3 IDs, we make another HTTP PUT request but to a different endpoint (route). As you might've guessed, that means we need to go back to our `deploy-commands.js` file to add a few more lines:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item deploy-commands.js
```js {7,16,23,25-36,38-41,43}
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require('@discordjs/builders');
const { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');
const { Routes } = require('discord-api-types/v9');
const { clientId, guildId, token } = require('./config.json');

const commands = [
	new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('ping').setDescription('Replies with pong!').setDefaultPermission(false),
	new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('server').setDescription('Replies with server info!'),
	new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('user').setDescription('Replies with user info!'),
].map(command => command.toJSON());

const rest = new REST({ version: '9' }).setToken(token);

(async () => {
	try {
		const response = await rest.put(
			Routes.applicationGuildCommands(clientId, guildId),
			{ body: commands },
		);

		console.log('Successfully registered application commands.');

    const pingCommand = response.find(cmd => cmd.name === 'ping');

    const fullPermissions = [
      {
        id: pingCommand.id,
        permissions: [
          {
            id: '1234567890',
            type: 1,
            permission: true,
          }
        ]
      }
    ];

    await rest.put(
      Routes.guildApplicationCommandsPermissions(clientId, guildId),
      { body: fullPermissions },
    );

    console.log('Successfully applied permission overwrite.');
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
	}
})();
```

::: warning
Again, we already mentioned at the very top of this page that we are not using the command handler version of the `index.js` and `deploy-commands.js` files for the sake of simplicity during explanation. However, all the concepts and examples in this page are also applicable for the command handler version of the aformentioned files.
:::

As you can see in line 16, calling `rest.put()` to this specific endpoint `Routes.applicationGuildCommands()` will return a response. We store that response in the variable `response`. This response will be an array of all the registered commands.

Then, in line 23, we retrieve the `ping` command from that array with [`Array.find()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find). Once we retrieve the `ping` command, we can access its ID from the `id` property.

- Guild ID âœ…
- Command ID âœ…
- User/role ID

Next, in line 25 to 33, we define an array of JSON objects with a very specific shape. This JSON object needs to have a property called `id` and `permissions`. The `id` should be the command ID (line 27) and the `permissions` should be an array of [Application Command Permissions Structure](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permissions-structure) objects (line 28-34). This `Application Command Permissions Structure` object needs to have three properties: `id`, `type`, and `permission`. The `id` will be the user id or role id that we want to whitelist (line 30). The `type` specifies what type of `id` it is (line 31). Type `1` means `ROLE` id, and type `2` means `USER` id. Finally, the `permission` specifies if we want to allow or disallow this `id` to use the command (line 32). If `permission` is `true` then it means allow, if it is `false` then it means disallow. Since our `ping` command is already registered with `setDefaultPermission(false)`, it wouldn't make much sense to also have a permission overwrite to disallow specific users or roles. On top of that, we are trying to enable this command for a specific role (i.e. whitelist the role), hence we should set `permission: true`.

- Guild ID âœ…
- Command ID âœ…
- User/role ID âœ…

Finally, we make the HTTP PUT request in line 38. However, we use a different endpoint (route) this time: `Routes.guildApplicationCommandsPermissions()` (line 39), and we pass our array in the body of the PUT request (line 40).

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

Go ahead and assign yourself that role in your guild. You should be able to use the `ping` command now. If you remove that role from yourself, you will see the `ping` command as disabled again.

::: warning
As you've probably noticed, we can only adjust the permissions of a command at the top-level. This means that we do not have the granularity of adjusting permissions for subcommand groups and/or subcommands.

Let's use the `/permissions` command from [Subcommands and Subcommand groups](#subcommands-and-subcommand-groups) as example. It's NOT possible to enable `/permissions user get` for a user, while also disabling `/permissions user edit` for that same user.
:::

### Alternative

You can also make permission overwrite with the bot itself.

```js:no-line-numbers {5}
const pingCommand = client.guilds.cache.get(guildId).commands.cache.find(cmd => cmd.name === 'ping');

const permissions: [
  {
    id: '1234567890',
    type: 'ROLE',
    permission: true,
  }
];

await pingCommand.permissions.set({ permissions });
```

All 3 IDs are satisfied here as well:

- Guild ID âœ…
- Command ID âœ…
- User/role ID âœ…

The Guild ID is specified in `guildId`.

The Command ID is built into the `pingCommand` variable, because it's an instance of [ApplicationCommand](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/ApplicationCommand).

The user/role ID is specified in the highlighted line.
