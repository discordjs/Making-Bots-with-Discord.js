# Deployment

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ On making it this far, now it's time to deploy your bot to production. ðŸš€

## Virtual Private Server

> VPS or virtual private server is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service.

There are a multitude of virtual private servers available, but the most popular ones, and the ones we will be covering in this guide, are:

-   [Linode]
-   [DigitalOcean]
-   [Vultr]
-   [Amazon EC2]

### Before you go all out

Before you go out and purchase a VPS, we recommend learning linux terminal basics and how to remotely connect to a VPS. The usual method is via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol). We won't go deep into it as thats outside of the scope of this guide, however VPS providers usually have a guide regarding connection so you can read up on that.

-   [Linode](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/connect-to-server-over-ssh/)
-   [DigitalOcean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/)
-   [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-access-your-vultr-vps/)
-   [Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html)

::: tip
If your using another provider, we recommend following there SSH instructions.
