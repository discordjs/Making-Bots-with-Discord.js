# Deployment

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ On making it this far, now it's time to deploy your bot to production. ðŸš€

## Virtual Private Server

> VPS or virtual private server is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service.

There are a multitude of virtual private servers available, but the most popular ones, and the ones we will be covering in this guide, are:

-   [Linode]
-   [DigitalOcean]
-   [Vultr]
-   [Amazon EC2]

### Recommended VPS Services (I will make a table explaining benefits of each tomorrow, going to bed now)
